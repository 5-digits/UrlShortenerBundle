[![Continuous Integration status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Ph3nol/UrlShortenerBundle.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Ph3nol/UrlShortenerBundle)

This bundle allows you to manage short URLs, linked to project contents/entities.

You actually can use an internal short links manager and current services API like bit.ly and goo.gl.

You are of course invited to contribute to this bundle! :)
